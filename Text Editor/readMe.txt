Creating a Text Editor in Java Swing.
This project is not finished yet,I will update the Code file and the readMe.txt every time i update my code.
So far I created a JFrame which will be my text editor and I added to it a TextField and save and load Buttons which do not do anything yet.

*updated on 11.01.2020
Today I uploaded a new version of my text editor.
I added actual saving and loading functions to my Jbuttons so now you can save and load the text you wrote in the textArea.
You can choose an extension you want when saving.
I also added a "new" JButton which creates a new empty file.Also, you can select the color with which you want to write.
